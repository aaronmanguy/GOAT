            The story is set during a religious war between two factions—the
            Union and the Empire—with the war tipping in favor of the Empire.
            The player controls Caim, a deposed prince of the Union, in his
            quest for vengeance against the Empire. Wounded in battle while
            protecting his sister Furiae, he is forced to make a pact with a red
            dragon named Angelus as they journey together on a quest to prevent
            the Empire from destroying magical seals that keep the world in
            balance.

            Drakengard and focuses on a man named Nier and his intention to seek
            a cure for his daughter Yonah, hit by the terrible disease "Black

            The story is set in 11945 AD, and revolves around a proxy war
            between the human-made androids and an invading army of alien-made
            Machines. Though they are prohibited from having emotions and lack
            true names, each android has a distinct personality. Which brings
            the intention of their creation into question.

            This is a remake of Nier Gestalt so they have almost the exact same
            story. The only differences (outside of graphical upgrades) are Nier
            is now Yonah's older brother instead of her father, and other minor
            changes
